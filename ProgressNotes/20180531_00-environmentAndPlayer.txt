===GitHub Workflow===

- GitHub
    - Class Repo
        - Fork class project repos to own repository.
    - Personal Repo
        - Clone the project to your local machine from your own repository.        
    - Local Machine
        - Work on the project, make changes to files, etc.
        - Add the altered files to the staging area.
        - Commit the changes.
        - Push the staged files to your personal repository with changelog notes.

===First Prototype: Roll-a-Ball===

- Basic Roll-a-Ball Unity3d tutorial project.

- https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/roll-ball-tutorial
    - Envrionment and Player
        - Setting up the Game
            + Make the Project
            - Create a new project with the name "Roll-a-Ball".
            - Save the project to a project folder location.
            - Create the project with the default 3D project settings.
            - Save the scene with the name "MiniGame" to the Assets directory under a new directory named "_scenes".

            + Add the Floor
            - Add a plane game object to the scene and name it "ground".
            - In the inspector, put the plane at the origin "(0, 0, 0)".
            - Add some color. Create a new folder under Assets named "_materials" and create a new material named "Background".
            - Select the new material, and under Main Maps in the inspector view, change the Albido property to a color of your choice.
            - Change the plane's material to Background.

            + Add the Ball
            - Add a sphere game object to the scene and name it "Player".
            - Place it at the origin and move it up the y-axis so the player is not superimposed in the ground later on.

            + Spruce it Up
            - Adjust the angle of the directional light as desired to achieve an aesthetically pleasing shadow.
            - Better yet, scrap the directional light and replace it with a nice spotlight and change the skybox to a starry night sky.
            - The default skybox is ugly as sin and is featured in thousands of poorly made prototypes which will make your prototype appear poorly made by association.
