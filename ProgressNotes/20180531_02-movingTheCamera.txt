===First Prototype: Roll-a-Ball===

- Basic Roll-a-Ball Unity3d tutorial project.

    - Moving the Camera
        + Third-Person Camera
        - Tie the camera to the Player object for a third-person view style of camera.
            - Move the camera up and tilt it down at a 45 degree angle so the Player is centered in the viewport (10 up on the y-axis and a 45 rotation downwards is fine for this).
            - Now we need to tie tie the camera to the player sphere via a script named "CameraController" under the _scripts directory.
            - Why are you working so hard? The script is made for you:
                - SU18-Roll-a-ball\Assets\_scripts\CameraController.cs
            - Drag and drop te camera script onto the main camera in the hierarchy.
                - Under the camera controller script component in the inspector window, change the Player proerty to use the Player game object in the current scene.
        + "I'm ready for my close up, Mr. GameDeville."
        - Great; now the camera follows the player object.
            - But the new angle makes the world and the player so tiny.
            - Let's choke that wide angle lens for a nice action shot.
                - Select the camera from the hierarchy, and change the FOV to 30 degrees.
                - Test it out. Looks good. Feels good. Let's save the scene and commit to git.
                - BUT WAIT. I'm terribly suceptible to motion sickness and this style of camera makes me want to vomit.
                    - I still want to see the player object, but I only want the camera to point at the player, not follow it.
                    - Luckily, there's a really simple method of doing this:
                        *BEGINCODE*
                        void Update() {
                                // Rotate the camera every frame so it keeps looking at the target
                                transform.LookAt(target); }
                        *ENDCODE*
            - For accessibility reasons, let's offer this as an alternative camera, and put this in a script named "TrackingCamera" under _scripts.
            - We don't have an interface to switch between cameras for now, but let's develop using this camera type for my own stomach's sake.
            - Let's remove the script component from the main camera and replace it with our new TrackingCamera script.
                - So that the camera knows what exactly to look at, change the Target property in the inspector to use the Player object.
            - Woah, much better on the eyes. The viewport now feels like a tangible vantage point rather than an etheral all-seeing-eye. Let's save and commit to git.
