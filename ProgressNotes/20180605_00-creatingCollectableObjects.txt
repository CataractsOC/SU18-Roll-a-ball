    - Creating Collectables
        + Creating the prefab
            - Let's make some pickups.
            - Create an empty game object in the hierarchy called "pickups" to group all our pickup objects.
            - Create a cube under pickups and set the rotation on each axis to 45.
            - Now let's add the rotator script to the object by dragging and dropping the script onto our cube to give it some movement.
            - Let's add some color as well. Create a new material for our pickup and drag and drop it onto our pickup.
            - If in case we need to recreate the same object with the same attiributes later on, let's turn this pickup into a prefab.
                - Create a new folder named "_prefabs" under Assets.
                - Drag and drop the pickup we created into the _prefabs folder.
                - Drag and drop the prefab multiple times into the scene and spread them around the maze.
            - Looking good. Let's save and commit to git.
