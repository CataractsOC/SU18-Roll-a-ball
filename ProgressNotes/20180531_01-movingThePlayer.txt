Topic:	Game Design - Beginning and Finishing Roll-a-Ball

===First Prototype: Roll-a-Ball===

- Basic Roll-a-Ball Unity3d tutorial project.

        - Moving the Player
            + Adding Physics
                - Thow a rigidbody component on the Player and make sure that gravity is enabled
                - This ensures that the Player stays humble, grounded, and, most importantly, /rigid/.

            + Empowering the Player with Directional Choice
                - We have to create a script that takes player input and applies directional force to the player object accordingly.
                - Let's make a script for this called "PlayerController" under a new "_scripts" directory under Assets.
                - Why are you working so hard? The script is made for you:
                    - SU18-Roll-a-ball\Assets\_scripts\PlayerController.cs
                - Drag and drop the script onto your Player object.
                    - Test it out and be astounded that a the default value of the script for player speed is 0.
                    - We want our player to move. So adjust the value within the inspector to accomidate your Need for Speed™.
