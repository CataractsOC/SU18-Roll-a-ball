# Description
In the year 21xx, the neo-upper class have farmed the hardware ID data from the cyberbrains of the lower class depthdwellers and have planned a mass genocide of the poor using these IDs as a kill-list. Crash Override - a lifelong wizard level braindiver is the resistance's top agent, and when his team mysteriously goes missing, their only hope. From a dirty payphone outside the city capitol, Crash injects his sp33dball virus to hack into the government mainframe to destroy all of the Excelseite datacubes. Will he succeed? You decide.
